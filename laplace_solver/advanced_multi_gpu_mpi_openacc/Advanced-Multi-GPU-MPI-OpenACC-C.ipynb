There are two major reasons why the scalability of a multi GPU program does not meet expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load Imbalances, i.e. some GPUs have to compute signficantly more work than others. This often results in idle GPUs waiting for the busy GPUs to finish.\n",
    "* Parallel Overhead caused by the necessary coordination of work of multiple GPUs, e.g. halo exchanges.\n",

    "## Scalability Metrics For Success\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in the **Introduction to Multi GPU Programming with MPI and OpenACC** lab the success of improvments for the multi GPU parallelization is measured with the following metrics. The provided tasks automatically print these metrics out at the end of each lab section/execution.\n",
    "\n",

    "In an OpenACC data region a CPU and a GPU copy of each scalar or array exists. Since MPI calls are executed by the CPU the default behavior of an OpenACC program is to use the CPU copy for these calls. In an OpenACC accelerated program however usually the GPU copy of the data is the one operated on so passing the CPU copy into MPI would result in communication of stale data and thus wrong results. The default behavior can be changed with the directive <code>host_data use_device</code>. <code>host_data use_device(A)</code> tells the OpenACC compiler to use the device representation of <code>A</code> in the following code block. Because we are using a CUDA-aware MPI the MPI implementation can handle these and do the halo updates directly to and from GPU memory.\n",

    "If you execute the initial version with `make -C C task1` in the cell below you will see that the domain decomposition used to distribute the work across multiple GPUs delivered a speed-up but does not attain optimal efficiency. This is because of the time that is needed (spent) to carry out the halo updates using MPI. This wasted time is called \"parallel overhead\" because it is a step not necessary for execution with a single GPU. We can lower the parallel overhead by doing computations in parallel with the MPI communication and therefore hide the communication time. In the case of our Jacobi solver, this is best done by splitting each domain into a boundary part (which updates all values that we need to communicate) and an inner part. By doing this split, we can start the MPI communication after the boundary part has finished, and let it run in parallel with the inner part:\n",

With only 4 GPUs the amount of data each GPU needs to exchange with its neighbors is the same for a tiled domain decomposition and a domain decomposition with stripes. Furthermore the tiled domain decomposition has a higher parallel overhead because of the necessary gather and scatter steps. With more GPUs this can change and doing the gather and scatter steps will pay off and lead to better scalabilty of the code."
